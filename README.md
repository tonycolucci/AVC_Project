# AVC_Project

## Charter

**Vision:**
The sport of ultimate frisbee has a dedicated niche following who are committed to playing and understanding the sport, but who do not currently have adequate statistical support. This project envisions an outlet for statistical inquiry of ultimate frisbee that drives further interest and understanding of the game, while providing insights worth a subscription fee.

**Mission:**
Provide a model that predicts the likelihood of success of a throw in an ultimate frisbee game based on a sample of throws collected from the 2017 USAU season. Allow the user to input example data into the model and generate a likelihood of throw success. 

**Success Criteria**
* Machine Learning metric: Correctly classify incompletions at an X% based on precision and recall
* Generate further interest in ultimate as measured by site visitors and page views, looking to reach X threshold and X% growth

## Planning
### Theme 1: Provide statistical insight into throws data
**Epic 1:**
Fit a predictive model that determines the likelihood of a given throw

*Stories*

**Epic 2:**
Score a throw-success likelihood based on user inputs to the app, including the impact of each feature on the score

*Stories*

### Theme 2:


## Backlog
* Create AWS Instance
* Generate model ideas
* Look for outside sources of data
* Assess 

## Icebox
* Create RDS Instance
* Write reproducibility tests
* Write requirements
* Write HTML front end for app

As a developer, I would like a data set containing text titles, their summaries, and their genre labeled so I can train my model.  | 4 | :heavy_check_mark:
